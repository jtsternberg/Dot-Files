# Trim front of file
# By Justin Sternberg <me@jtsternberg.com>
# https://github.com/jtsternberg/Dot-Files/blob/master/bin/trim-front
#
# Version 0.1.0
#
# Takes a file path as the first parameter,
# and (optionally) a second parameter to
# specify the number of lines to keep.
#
# If file has more lines than the number to keep,
# this script will trim the front of the file.
#
# Useful for purging old data in a log file.
#
# Usage:
# trim-front debug.log 1000
# =============================================================================
